# React.js Coding Challenge

Firstly, Thanks a lot for giving me the opportunity to participate in the coding challenge. I've included some quick notes:

### Notes:

- I didn't want to include any styling libraries like Tailwind, I decided to go with just plain CSS.
- I tried not to mess with the boilerplate you gave me. expect the bpmn-js where I moved the imports into a dedicated component
- I tried to write the code in a way that doesn't need explanatory comments. I put this into practice throughout the challenge. I always aim for code that's easy to read.
